# Weather Forecasting Website


## Introduction
This project is a weather forecasting website that allows users to search for weather information by city or country and view the current weather, 7-day forecast, and 24-hour forecast.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for weather information by entering a city or country.

- **Display Options**: Weather information can be displayed in °C or °F.

- **Location Access**: The website requests the user's location upon access. If the user declines, the default location is set to "Vietnam".

- **Current Weather Information**: Displays the current weather status, location, date, time, feels-like temperature, humidity, rain probability, and wind speed.

- **7-Day Forecast**: Shows the weather forecast for the next 7 days.

- **24-Hour Forecast**: Displays the weather forecast for the next 24 hours.


## User Stories

5. As a user, I want to switch between °C and °F so that I can view the temperature in my preferred unit.


## Project Management
- **Git and GitHub**: We use Git as our version control system to track changes in our codebase. GitHub serves as our remote repository where we store and collaborate on our code.

- **Trello**: We use Trello as our project management tool to organize tasks and track progress. Our Trello board is divided into lists such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". Each task card includes details and can be assigned to team members for transparency and accountability.
